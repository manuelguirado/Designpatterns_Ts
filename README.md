  
I'm learning design patterns with TypeScript to improve my knowledge in backend development.
  
This repository contains examples and explanations of various design patterns implemented in TypeScript. By studying these patterns, I aim to write more maintainable, scalable, and efficient backend code. The patterns covered include creational, structural, and behavioral patterns, each demonstrated with practical TypeScript code samples. This learning process will help me apply best practices and architectural solutions to real-world backend projects.
